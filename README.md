# Hashing-Concept
1. We created a 2x2 array because we want to place negatie numbers in a separate row instead of essing up things
2. hastable is made to store the value of the array in a special way so that we can check if a certain element is present in the array by simple hashing function instead of going through each index
3. this reduces the time complexity to O(1) instead of O(n), where n is the size of array
4. hasing lets us play with indecies with less time complexity
5. in future examples we shall see more cases
